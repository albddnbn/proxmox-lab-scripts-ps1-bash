## This is a collection of scripts I'm in the process of developing. The scripts have risen from my usage of Proxmox, and a number of different 'home lab' experiments.

### Explanation of directories:

- UserInstallationFramework - this project has it's own repository as of ~June, 2024: [PSADT-Install-Framework](https://github.com/albddnbn/psadt-install-framework)
- adlab - bash and Powershell scripts to 1. Generate DC and client Windows VMs using the Proxmox API, and 2. Install/Configure basic elements of AD DS on the DC VM.
- bash - directory to keep useful bash snippets, other code sections. Not much in here right now.
- config-scripts - Scripts for configuring Windows and other systems, all registry edits and variations thereof right now.
- installs - Scripts for installing software, mostly using the PSADT framework. The first place I check for my installation scripts is silentinstallhq.com. If I can't find an installation script that's already been written, I create it myself and save it here.
- seedbox - scripts I've created or used and adapted to deal with media on seedbox and plex server.

### I'm planning to create a more detailed walkthrough of the Proxmox AD Lab scripts very soon!
