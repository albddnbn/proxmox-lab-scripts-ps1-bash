# Active Directory Test Lab Setup

This project is currently a work in progress.

The goal of this project is to create a script that sets up the basic components of an Active Directory (AD) test lab. 

## Future Plans

Project will include a script that can be run from the Proxmox Shell to handle creation of VMs, the SDN components, firewall rules, and other configurations necessary to get things started quickly.
